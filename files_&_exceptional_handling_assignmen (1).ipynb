        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " -  In interpreted languages, code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, meaning no separate executable file is generated. Examples include Python and JavaScript. Compiled languages, on the other hand, require the code to be translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, producing an independent executable file. Examples include C and C++. Interpreted languages are easier to debug but generally slower, while compiled languages tend to be faster but less flexible during runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " -  Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to deal with errors or exceptional situations gracefully without abruptly terminating the program. It involves using try, except, else, and finally blocks to catch exceptions and take corrective action, ensuring the application continues running smoothly or fails in a controlled manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " -  The finally block is used to define code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is commonly used for cleanup actions like closing files, releasing resources, or disconnecting from databases to prevent resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " -  Logging in Python refers to recording messages, events, or errors during a program’s execution. It helps developers monitor program behavior, debug issues, and track system activity. The logging module provides a standardized way to log messages at different severity levels such as debug, info, warning, error, and critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " -  The __del__ method is a special method in Python, called a destructor, that is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed. It’s often used to release resources or perform cleanup before the object is removed from memory. However, its use is generally discouraged in favor of context managers.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " -  Using import imports the entire module, requiring you to prefix functions or variables with the module name. For example, import math requires math.sqrt(4). In contrast, from ... import allows importing specific functions, classes, or variables from a module directly, such as from math import sqrt, enabling you to use sqrt(4) without the module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " -  Multiple exceptions can be handled using multiple except blocks, each specifying a different exception type. Alternatively, a single except block can handle multiple exceptions by grouping them in parentheses, such as except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " -  The with statement ensures that a file is properly opened and closed automatically, even if an exception occurs during file operations. It simplifies resource management and reduces the risk of file leaks by automatically calling the file’s close() method when the block is exited.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " -  Multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process, sharing memory space, making it lightweight but limited by Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Multiprocessing uses separate processes, each with its own memory space, allowing true parallel execution but with higher memory and communication overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - Logging provides a permanent record of events, errors, and system behavior. It aids in debugging, performance monitoring, and auditing. Unlike print() statements, logging can be configured to record messages at various severity levels and to output logs to files, consoles, or external systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " -  Python handles memory management automatically using a private heap where all objects are stored. It includes built-in garbage collection to reclaim unused memory. Developers can also manage memory usage by deleting references to objects and using efficient data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " -  The steps are: wrap the code in a try block, catch exceptions using one or more except blocks, optionally use else for code that runs when no exception occurs, and finally for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " -  Efficient memory management prevents excessive memory consumption, which could slow down or crash applications. Proper memory handling ensures smooth program execution, especially for large-scale or resource-intensive applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " -  The try block contains code that might raise exceptions, while the except block catches and handles specific or general exceptions, allowing the program to recover gracefully or exit cleanly without crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " -  Python uses reference counting to track the number of references to an object. When the count drops to zero, the object is deleted. It also uses a cyclic garbage collector to clean up objects involved in reference cycles that cannot be freed through reference counting alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " -  The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block. It’s typically used for code that should execute when the try block succeeds, keeping it separate from exception-handling logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " -  The main logging levels are DEBUG (detailed diagnostic information), INFO (general application events), WARNING (potential problems), ERROR (errors that affect functionality), and CRITICAL (serious errors causing program termination).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " -  os.fork() is a low-level Unix/Linux system call that creates a new process by duplicating the current one, available only on Unix-like systems. The multiprocessing module is cross-platform, higher-level, and provides an API for creating and managing processes with better portability and control.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " -  Closing a file releases the system resources associated with it and ensures that all buffered data is written to disk. Failing to close files can lead to resource leaks or data corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        " -  file.read() reads the entire file (or a specified number of characters) into a single string, while file.readline() reads only one line at a time, including the newline character.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        " -  The logging module is a built-in Python library that provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from programs. It supports different logging levels, output destinations, and formatting options.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " -  The os module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including file handling tasks like creating, removing, renaming, and checking the existence of files and directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " -  Challenges include dealing with reference cycles, managing large data structures efficiently, avoiding memory leaks caused by lingering references, and optimizing memory use for performance-critical applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " -  An exception can be raised manually using the raise keyword followed by the exception type, such as raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\"). This is useful for enforcing constraints or signaling errors intentionally.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        " -  Multithreading is useful for tasks involving I/O-bound operations, such as network requests or file operations, where threads can work concurrently without being limited by CPU processing speed. It improves responsiveness and efficiency in such applications."
